**Project:** Automated End-to-End Testing of nopCommerce Demo Portal  
**Tester:** Aleksa Aleksić  
**Duration:** 29-09-2025 to 03-10-2025  
**Base URL:** [https://demo.nopcommerce.com](https://demo.nopcommerce.com)

## 1. Introduction

This report summarizes the comprehensive end-to-end automation testing efforts on the nopCommerce Demo e-commerce portal. Over five days, functional, negative, and deterministic test scenarios were executed across Authentication, Catalog, Cart, Checkout, and Profile modules to validate core functionalities and ensure stability.

The project demonstrates practical automated testing skills with **Playwright**, **TypeScript**, **Page Object Model (POM)**, **Allure Reporting**, and **GitHub Actions CI/CD integration**.

**Modules Tested:** Authentication, Catalog, Cart, Checkout, Profile  
**Artifacts Produced:** Test Suites, Page Objects, Fixtures, Execution Logs, Allure Reports, Screenshots, Daily Reports, GitHub Actions CI Workflow

---

## 2. Scope & Objectives

**Scope:**

- Functional validation of core e-commerce workflows  
- Positive, negative, and deterministic test scenarios  
- Automated execution with screenshots on failure  
- CI/CD integration for continuous validation

**Objectives:**

1. Verify end-to-end user flows: registration, login, product search, cart management, checkout, profile updates  
2. Detect and report UI regressions, data inconsistencies, and navigation issues  
3. Generate professional test artifacts suitable for a junior QA portfolio  
4. Implement automated reporting with Allure and CI/CD integration

## 3. Test Environment & Tools

**OS:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS  
**Browsers:** Chromium, Firefox, WebKit  
**Node.js:** 20.x  
**IDE:** Visual Studio Code  
**Automation Tools:** Playwright (TypeScript), Page Object Model, Fixtures  
**Reporting:** Allure Playwright (HTML + steps + screenshots)  
**Version Control:** Git & GitHub  
**CI/CD:** GitHub Actions workflow for automated test execution

## 5. Test Case Coverage & Metrics

| Module          | Test Cases | PASS | FAIL |
|-----------------|------------|------|------|
| Authentication  | 8          | 8    | 0    |
| Catalog         | 7          | 7    | 0    |
| Cart            | 6          | 6    | 0    |
| Checkout        | 6          | 6    | 0    |
| Profile         | 5          | 5    | 0    |
| **Total**       | 32         | 32   | 0    |

- **Execution Duration:** 5 days  
- **Average per Test Case:** ~12 minutes  
- **Overall Test Pass Rate:** 100%

## 6. Defect Analysis

- **High Severity:** None reported; all critical flows passed successfully  
- **Medium/Low Severity:** Minor locator adjustments and stubbed network responses to ensure deterministic results  
- **Root Causes:** Initial minor flaky behaviors were caused by dynamic elements and demo site data changes; mitigated by fixture data and explicit waits  

---

## 7. Notes on Demo Site & Locator Strategy

- The **nopCommerce demo site is dynamic**, meaning products are frequently added or removed.  
- To accommodate this, **generic/universal locators** were used for products (e.g., selectors based on product container classes rather than specific names).  
- While the **flow and automation logic reflect real-world E2E testing**, some product-related tests **may fail in the future** if the demo catalog changes significantly.  
- The chosen approach demonstrates **how tests should be structured and maintained** in principle, emphasizing modular POM design, fixture usage, and deterministic test practices.

## 8. Exploratory & Additional Insights

1. Explicit waits and `expect` assertions improved stability for dynamic elements  
2. Fixture data ensured deterministic search and filtering tests  
3. Allure Reports provided visual step-by-step execution with screenshots  
4. GitHub Actions CI ensured automated execution on every push/PR  
5. POM structure enabled maintainable and reusable code across modules  

---

## 9. Lessons Learned & Recommendations

1. **Locator Consistency:** Prefer stable generic locators or data attributes for dynamic content  
2. **Deterministic Tests:** Use fixture data and network stubbing for predictable results  
3. **CI/CD Practices:** Automated workflows reduce manual execution errors and streamline portfolio presentation  
4. **Modular POM:** Maintain modular, reusable page objects to simplify test expansion  
5. **Portfolio Readiness:** Complete artifacts, reports, and documentation demonstrate a professional QA skill set

## 10. Conclusion

All modules of the nopCommerce E2E Playwright Automation Project were tested successfully with **100% pass rate**. Deterministic tests, Allure reporting, screenshots, and GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline were fully implemented.  

Although the demo site is dynamic and product changes may cause future test failures, the automation logic and approach correctly reflect **real-world best practices** for E2E testing.  

This project demonstrates strong foundational QA automation skills suitable for a junior tester portfolio. All test artifacts, reports, and workflow files are ready for review.
